<h1>I'm a fucking webmaster</h1>
<p>Back in 1993 you weren't a designer, developer, copywriter or in devops. You were a fucking webmaster, and your name was at the bottom of every page.</p>
<p>Let's talk about that. <strong>Your name was in the footer of every fucking page.</strong> The domain might have said <a href="http://tomstrucking.net">tomstrucking.net</a>, but it was built, hosted, and maintained by one person. If you had a question, you emailed <a href="mailto:webmaster@tomstrucking.net">webmaster@tomstrucking.net</a>.</p>
<p>And that address got a lot of email:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;Please play the Star Trek theme when people get to my site&quot;<br>
  </li>
  <li>&quot;Can you show the number of visitors to my web page?&quot;<br>
  </li>
  <li>&quot;I want my headline to be <span class="blink">blinking</span>.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Folks treated webmasters like god damned magicians. Just email us with your cyberspace dreams, and we'll try to make them a reality.</p>
<p><em>We couldn't draw, but we harnessed simple design patterns and made them work.<br>
  We weren't engineers, but we could bend a CGI script to our will.<br>
  We weren't writers, but we discovered that words were the core of every page.</em></p>
<p>In the process of doing all these things, we fell in love.</p>
<p>We fell in love with <span class="third-degree">VARIETY</span>.</p>
<p>People would come to us with a <strong>problem</strong> and we would have to figure out a <strong>solution</strong>. We couldn't always just search the web, <strong>because the web was still being written</strong>. And you couldn't just punt a hard question to the engineer in the desk next to you. Why? Because you were sitting alone in a utility closet packed with floppy disks and old tape drives.</p>
<p>Now, in a culture that rewards specialization, we've been forced to choose. Almost haphazardly we picked a niche. Some of us became web designers, or developers. Others became founders. There's a group of us that decided we liked writing the best. And, god bless 'em, there's still good folks configuring servers and making the damned machines work.</p>
<p>But in our heart, we miss the old days. We miss being webmasters. </p>
<p><strong>This is good. Because the world needs some fucking webmasters.</strong></p>
<p>It feels like every web project these days starts with hundreds of dependencies, and hours of debate about which framework is best.</p>
<p>How about we get a fucking websmaster in here to write some HTML snf put it on a serve so we can look at it? Yes, let's iterate on it. Yes, eventually let's make it look good and work good and all that other shit. <strong>But can we at least get this project started?</strong></p>
<p>Nobody wants to start small anymore. Webmasters are good at that.</p>
<p>We need people that are willing to roll up their sleeves (no matter what their title) and do whatever needs doing. Need some email answered? Done. Want some copy written? I'll do it. Server needs to be rebooted? I'll figure it out.</p>
<p>I'm not saying we don't need specialists. But let's quit maligning the generalists. </p>
<p>To hell with this stigma around. When people ask you what you do, don't say <em>technologist</em> or some other garbage. Look 'em right in the eye and say: <strong>I'm a fucking webmaster.</strong></p>
