<h1>I'm a fucking webmaster</h1>
<p>Back in 1993 you weren't a designer, developer, copywriter or in devops. You were a fucking webmaster, and your name was at the bottom of every page.</p>
<p>Let's talk about that. <strong>Your name was in the footer of every fucking page.</strong> The domain might have said <a href="http://tomstrucking.net">tomstrucking.net</a>, but it was built, hosted, and maintained by one person. If you had a question, you emailed <a href="mailto:webmaster@tomstrucking.net">webmaster@tomstrucking.net</a>.</p>
<p>And that address got a lot of email:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;Please play the Star Trek theme when people get to my site&quot;<br>
  </li>
  <li>&quot;Can you show the number of visitors to my web page?&quot;<br>
  </li>
  <li>&quot;I want my headline to be <span class="blink">blinking</span>.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Folks treated webmasters like god damned magicians. Just email us with your cyberspace dreams, and we'll try to make them a reality.</p>
<p><em>We couldn't draw, but we harnessed simple design patterns and made them work.<br>
  We weren't engineers, but we could bend a CGI script to our will.<br>
  We weren't writers, but we discovered that words were the core of every page.</em></p>
<p>In the process of doing all these things, we fell in love.</p>
<p>We fell in love with <span class="third-degree">VARIETY</span>.</p>
<p>People would come to us with a <strong>problem</strong> and we would have to figure out a <strong>solution</strong>. We couldn't always just search the web, <strong>because the web was still being written</strong>. And you couldn't just punt a hard question to the engineer in the desk next to you. Why? Because you were sitting alone in a utility closet packed with floppy disks and old tape drives.</p>
<p>Now, in a culture that rewards specialization, we've been forced to choose. Some of us became web designers, or developers. Others became founders. There's a group of us that decided we liked writing the best. And, god bless 'em, there's still good folks configuring servers and making the damned machines work.</p>
<p><strong>But the best part is we learned how to make websites.</strong> This, as it turns out, is pretty fucking fantastic.</p>
<p>Once you created a simple HTML page, and published it, there was no going back. Whether you were passionate about <a href="https://www.spork.org/">sporks</a>, loved <a href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/jhb/whisky/">whisky</a>, or hated <a href="http://toastytech.com/evil/index.html">Internet Explorer</a>, you could express that online. And all you really needed was a text editor (and maybe an FTP client). If we were magicians, than the web was our magic.</p>
<p>And while we might not have made the prettiest websites, we got good at communicating ideas. We focused on <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/words.html">words</a>, hiearchy, and structure. Each new page started in a text editor looking something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;What's this page about?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what this page is about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information &lt;a href="#"&gt;go here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Some of that simplicity and focus is missing from today's web. </p>
<p>And webmasters, maybe that's our superpower. We've seen the web grow in it's reach, but we've also seen it grow in it's complexity. It feels like there's more barriers to entry, more gatekeepers, and more walled gardens. <strong>But we know that at it's core a web page is simple.</strong> You can put abstractions on top of it. You can weigh it down. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's remember the words of a great Knight:</p>
<blockquote>
Let's use the web to create neat new exciting things.<br>
Let's use the Web to help people understand each other.

<p>We might not all be making websites professionally anymore. But we're still making websites. When people ask you who you are, don't say <em>technologist</em> or some other garbage. Look 'em right in the eye and say: <strong>I'm a fucking webmaster.</strong></p>
